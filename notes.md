#Steps for Building a CLI Gem

[x] 1. Plan gem, imagine the interface (idea is to have a good sense of what you want to build from the userâ€™s perspective)
[x] 2. Start with the project structure (use google!)
[x] 3. Start with the entry point (file run)
[x] 4. Force that to build the CLI interface
[ ] 5. Stub out the interface
  [ ] a. list view
  [ ] b. detail view
    [ ] determine what attributes are needed 
  => still need to style the interface properly
[ ] 6. Start making things real
[ ] 7. Discover objects
[ ] 8. Program
